On June 20, 2013, blogger Turner Barr went public on his blog, Around the World in 80 Jobs, with a dispute he was having with Adecco. Adecco had claimed a trademark on the term "Around the World in 80 Jobs," which they had used for a marketing campaign. Barr contended that his brand and likeness had been stolen. The story quickly went viral, particularly in the travel blogging community. On June 26, 2013, Adecco agreed to Turner's terms, issued a public apology, and changed the name of its contest to the "Work Experience Contest".

Additionally the respondent was ordered not to cause or permit any steps to be taken to register another company with an offending name which could interfere, due to its similarity, with the goodwill of the applicant.
