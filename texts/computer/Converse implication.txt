Converse implication is the converse of implication. That is to say; that for any two propositions P and Q, if Q implies P, then P is the converse implication of Q.
It may take the following forms:

p q, Bpq, or p q






The truth table of A B



The Venn diagram of "If B then A" (the white area shows where the statement is false)



truth-preserving: The interpretation under which all variables are assigned a truth value of 'true' produces a truth value of 'true' as a result of converse implication.






"Not q without p."
"p if q."



(A + B')
