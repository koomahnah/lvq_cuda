5 -Dihydrocorticosterone ((5 ,11 )-11,21-dihydroxypregnane-3,20-dione; abbreviated as 5 -DHC, 5 -DHB) is a naturally-occurring, endogenous glucocorticoid steroid hormone and neurosteroid. It is biosynthesized from corticosterone by the enzyme 5 -reductase. DHC has central depressant effects and impairs long-term potentiation in animals.
