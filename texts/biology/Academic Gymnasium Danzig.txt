The Academic Gymnasium Danzig (German: Akademisches Gymnasium Danzig, Polish: Gda skie Gimnazjum Akademickie), was a school founded in Danzig (formerly in Royal Prussia and now Gda sk, Poland) [3] [4] It was founded in 1558 by Johann Hoppe (1512 1565), who had previously worked at schools in Culm (Che mno) and Elbing (Elbl g) until Catholic Prince-Bishop Stanislaus Hosius closed them. For most of its existence it had a character similar to that of a university, and after 1580 it was named Akademisches Gymnasium Danzig.



It was in operation as educational gymnasium for Lutheran clergy until 1817. It was one of the most developed educational centers in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. It also was the site of Collegium Medicum-one of the first associations of doctors in Polish-controlled territories.
In the 16th century, as many cities in Prussia became Lutheran, the population began to seek a Lutheran education. The University of K nigsberg in neighbouring Ducal Prussia, founded in 1544, was not big enough to educate all the new Protestant clerics and administrators needed for the newly Lutheran state in addition to arrivals from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, so local Latin schools in the Commonwealth were upgraded. The future home of the Gymnasium would be the former Franciscan monastery turned into a school. In 1539, a Schola Dantiscana program was started by Andreas Aurifaber. In 1558 Johann Hoppe founded a secular gymnasium that would become the Academic Gymnasium Danzig. Achatius Curaeus (1531 1594), from the University of Wittenberg, was made the first rector, but due to the theological conflicts between Gnesio-Lutherans and Philippists, he soon left.
In 1580, the school received the title Academic Gymnasium. Along with similar schools in Elbing and Thorn (now Elblag, Torun), the gymnasium transformed the province of Royal Prussia into a center of classical studies in the 16th century.
In 1817, when Danzig was part of the Kingdom of Prussia, it was changed to a municipal gymnasium and named St dtisches Gymnasium Danzig (City High School of Danzig), in contrast to the earlier the (royal) K nigliches Gymnasium. The Academic Gymnasium Danzig was in operation until March 1945, when Danzig fell to the Red Army. Subsequently the city, as Gda sk, became part of Poland.



People connected with it are, among others, Bartholom us Keckermann, Johannes Hevelius, Andreas Gryphius, Christian Hoffmann von Hoffmannswaldau, Peter Cr ger, Abraham Calov, Michael Christoph Hanow (Hanov(ious), Gottfried Lengnich, Hugo M nsterberg, Karl Friedrich Schinkel.
In June 2008, the National Museum in Gda sk unveiled a memorial table dedicated to Academic Gymnasium to mark the 450th anniversary of its founding.
