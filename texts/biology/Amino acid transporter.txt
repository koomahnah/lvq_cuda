An amino acid transporter is a membrane transport protein that transports amino acids. They are mainly of the solute carrier family.



(1) high affinity glutamate and neutral amino acid transporter
(3) heavy subunits of heteromeric amino acid transporters
(6) Bacterial Leucine Transporter (LeuT) 
(7) cationic amino acid transporter/glycoprotein-associated
(15) proton oligopeptide cotransporter
(17) vesicular glutamate transporter
(18) vesicular amine transporter
(25) some mitochondrial carriers
(26) multifunctional anion exchanger
(32) vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter
(36) proton-coupled amino acid transporter
(38) System A & N, sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter



Vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT) is responsible for the storage of GABA and glycine in neuronal synaptic vesicles.
