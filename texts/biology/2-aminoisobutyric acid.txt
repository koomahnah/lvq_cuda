2-Aminoisobutyric acid, or  -aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) or  -methylalanine or 2-methylalanine, is an amino acid with the structural formula is H2N-C(CH3)2-COOH. It is contained in some antibiotics of fungal origin, e.g. alamethicin and some lantibiotics. It is not one of the proteinogenic amino acids and rather rare in nature (cf. Non-proteinogenic amino acids).  -Aminoisobutyric acid is a strong helix inducer in peptides. Its oligomers form 3-10 helices.
In the laboratory, 2-aminoisobutyric acid may be prepared from acetone cyanohydrin, by reaction with ammonia followed by hydrolysis.
