11-Deoxycortisol, also known as cortodoxone (INN, USAN, BAN), as well as 17-hydroxy-11-deoxycorticosterone, 17 ,21-dihydroxyprogesterone, and cortexolone, is a glucocorticoid steroid hormone that can be oxygenated to cortisol (hydrocortisone). It was first synthesized by Tadeusz Reichstein, and has also been referred to as Reichstein's Substance.
On April 5, 1952, biochemist Durey Peterson and microbiologist Herbert Murray at Upjohn published the first report of a breakthrough fermentation process for the microbial 11 -oxygenation of steroids (e.g. progesterone) in a single step by common molds of the order Mucorales.
11 -oxygenation of cortodoxone produces 11 -hydrocortisone, which can be chemically oxidized to cortisone, or converted by further chemical steps to cortisol.
Subsequent fermentation processes for the microbial 11 -oxygenation of steroids in a single step were developed that could convert cortodoxone directly to cortisol.
Cortodoxone functions as a glucocorticoid, though is less potent than cortisol. It can be synthesized from 17-hydroxyprogesterone. In 11 -hydroxylase deficiency, cortodoxone levels increase dramatically, causing hypertension (as opposed to 21 -hydroxylase deficiency, in which patients have low blood pressure from a lack of mineralocorticoids).
Cortodoxone can also be converted to androstenedione. This could explain, at least in part, the marked increase in androstenedione levels in 11 -hydroxylase deficiency.
