Afro-Arabs are individuals and groups from Africa who are of partial Arab descent. Most Afro-Arabs inhabit the Swahili Coast in the African Great Lakes region as well as Sudan and Mauritania, although some can also be found in other parts of the Arab world.
"Afro-Arab" may also refer to the African Union's efforts to improve cooperation between nations inside of Africa and the Arab world.



In Eastern Arabia's Arab states of the Persian Gulf, descendants of people from the Swahili Coast perform traditional Liwa and Fann At-Tanbura music and dance. The mizmar is also performed by Afro-Arabs in the Tihamah and Hejaz regions of Saudi Arabia.
In addition, Stambali of Tunisia and Gnawa music of Morocco are both ritual music and dances, which in part trace their origins to West African musical styles.
