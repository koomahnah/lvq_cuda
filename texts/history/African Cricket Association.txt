South African and Zimbabwean Cricket is independently administered by their own boards, however the ACA is responsible for the administration, promotion and development across the rest of the Africa continent. They are also responsible for the development of coaching and umpiring, and expanding cricket administration within national organisations on the African Continent. Prior to the Creation of the ACA, and the rest of Africa was administered by two separate organisations, the East and Central Africa Cricket Conference and the West Africa Cricket Council.
