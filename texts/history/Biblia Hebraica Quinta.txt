The Biblia Hebraica Quinta, or BH5, is the fifth edition of the Biblia Hebraica and when complete will supersede the fourth edition, the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS).



Like the third and fourth editions, the BH5 uses a text based on the Leningrad Codex; the text has been corrected against colour photographs of the codex taken in the 1990s.
Unlike previous editions, it includes a commentary explaining the Masorah and discussing the significance of the textual variants in the footnotes. It also contains the Masorah magna, which was not in the first three versions and only available in a supplementary volume in BHS. Another change is that it rarely cites variants from Hebrew manuscripts collated by Benjamin Kennicott and C. D. Ginsburg; the editors, following the work of Moshe Goshen-Gottstein, believe that such variants are of little value.



The work is currently being published in fascicles according to this release schedule: 
The first fascicle (general introduction and The Five Megilloth, part 18) was published in 2004. The books are in the same order as in the Leningrad Codex and BHS, namely Ruth, Canticles (Song of Songs), Qoheleth (Ecclesiastes), Lamentations and Esther.
The second fascicle (Ezra and Nehemiah, part 20) was published in 2006.
The third fascicle (Deuteronomy, part 5) was published in September 2007.
The fourth fascicle (Proverbs, part 17) was published in February 2009.
The fifth fascicle (The Twelve Minor Prophets, part 13) was published in November 2010.
The sixth fascicle (Judges, part 7) was published in March 2012.



That Eisenbrauns web page predicts that the entire Hebrew Bible will be completed by 2020. The German Bible Society makes the same prediction on web pages for the fascicles of the Twelve Minor Prophets and of Proverbs, though the German Bible Society web pages for some of the earlier fascicles still predict 2015. At the moment the endmost date on the release table says 2017, with other dates still unknown.
